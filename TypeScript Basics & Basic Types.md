### TypeScript Core Types

TypeScript, as a statically typed superset of JavaScript, provides a set of core types, including number, string, and boolean. Let's me describe each of them in detail:

#### 'number'

- The number type in TypeScript represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
- It can be used to define variables that store numeric values, such as age, price, or any kind of quantity.
- TypeScript ensures type safety by allowing only numeric values to be assigned to variables of this type.
- For example, you can declare a variable as follows:

```let age: number = 30;```

#### 'string'

- The string type represents textual data, such as words, sentences, or any sequence of characters.
- It's commonly used for storing and manipulating text in variables.
- TypeScript ensures that you can only assign string values to variables of this type.
- Here's an example:

``` let name: string = "Tomislav"; ```

#### 'boolean'

- The boolean type represents logical values - either true or false.
- It's often used for storing and working with conditions or states in code.
- Variables of type boolean can only hold true or false values.
- Example usage:

```let isRemoteJob: boolean = true;```

These core types are essential building blocks in TypeScript, helping developers ensure type safety and improve code readability and maintainability. 

They provide a strong foundation for creating more complex data structures and custom types as needed for your API integration work.
