#### Classes & Instances

**Classes**:
- Think of them as blueprints or templates. They define the properties and methods (functions) that objects of that type will have.
- Classes themselves are not objects. They serve as a reference for creating objects.

**Instances**:
- These are the actual objects created from a class. They each have their own set of properties and methods inherited from the class.
- You create an instance using the new keyword followed by the class name.
- Each instance has its own unique identity and data. Even though they share the same blueprint, their properties and method calls can have different results.
