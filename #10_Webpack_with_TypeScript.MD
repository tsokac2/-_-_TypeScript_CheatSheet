### <a name="webpack">What is Webpack & Why do we need it?</a>

Webpack helps you build cleaner, more efficient, and maintainable JavaScript applications by organizing your code, optimizing bundled files, and supporting modern development practices.

**Here's why Webpack is valuable**:

- **Organization**: It keeps your codebase organized and manageable, making it easier to collaborate and maintain.
- **Efficiency**: Webpack optimizes the bundled files, reducing their size and improving loading times for your website.
- **Modularization**: It promotes code reusability by allowing you to share modules across different parts of your application.
- **Flexibility**: Webpack supports various loaders and plugins, allowing you to transform different types of assets (CSS, images, etc.) and integrate them into your bundles.
- **Modern features**: Webpack can handle modern JavaScript features like ES6 modules and transpile them into formats compatible with older browsers.
